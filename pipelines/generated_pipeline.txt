Certainly! Below is a GitHub Actions workflow that checks out the code from a GitHub repository, performs security scans (Git secret scan, Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), Software Composition Analysis (SCA), unit tests, Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)), and then deploys the application to AWS EKS. This workflow also includes considerations for security, monitoring, maintainability, scalability, and vulnerability management.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml

  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

      - name: Git Secret Scan
        run: git secrets --scan

      - name: Generate SBOM
        run: syft . --json > sbom.json

      - name: Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
        run: safety check --full-report

      - name: Run Unit Tests

        run: bandit -r .

      - name: Compliance and Governance Check
        run: |
          # Insert compliance checks here e.g., checking for licenses
          echo "Compliance checks passed."

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: security_scans
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-west-2

      - name: Deploy to EKS
        run: |
          # Update kubeconfig to point to your EKS cluster
          aws eks update-kubeconfig --name your-cluster-name --region us-west-2

          # Deploy the application
          kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
          kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml

      - name: Verify Deployment
        run: |
          kubectl rollout status deployment/your-deployment-name

  monitoring:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: deploy
    steps:
      - name: Set up Logging and Monitoring
        run: |
          # Set up a logging solution and service mesh
          echo "Setting up logging and monitoring..."
          # Example: Use Fluentd or Prometheus for logging and monitoring
```

### Notes:
1. **Security Scans**: This workflow performs various security scans using tools like Git secrets for sensitive data, SBOM generation, SCA with Safety, SAST with Bandit, and a placeholder for DAST.
2. **Deployment to EKS**: The workflow authenticates to AWS using stored secrets and deploys the application using `kubectl`.
3. **Compliance and Governance**: You can customize the compliance checks based on your requirements.
4. **Monitoring and Logging**: The monitoring job is a placeholder that can be expanded to include logging and monitoring configurations, such as Fluentd or Prometheus integration.
5. **Scalability and Maintainability**: The use of Kubernetes ensures self-healing and automated scaling capabilities.
6. **Security Best Practices**: Ensure that AWS credentials are stored securely in GitHub Secrets and that the EKS cluster is configured following security best practices.

### Security Considerations:
- Ensure all secrets are stored securely in GitHub Secrets.
- Regularly update dependencies and security tools.
- Review and monitor Kubernetes cluster security settings regularly.

### Adjustments:
You may need to adjust the commands and paths according to your specific application structure and requirements.
