Creating an Azure DevOps pipeline to execute Terraform code upon approval of a pull request (PR) involves several steps, including setting up your Azure DevOps environment, configuring the pipeline, and ensuring that the necessary permissions and integrations are in place. Below is a detailed guide, along with the YAML code for the pipeline.

### Prerequisites

1. **Azure DevOps Account**: You need an active Azure DevOps account and a project created within it.

2. **Terraform Installed**: Ensure that you have Terraform installed locally for initial testing.

3. **Azure Subscription**: You need an active Azure subscription to provision resources.

4. **Service Connection**: Create a service connection in Azure DevOps to allow the pipeline to authenticate with Azure. This is typically done using the Azure Resource Manager service connection.

5. **Repository**: Your Terraform code should be in a repository in Azure DevOps.

6. **Approvals and Checks**: Configure branch policies to require PR approvals.

7. **Agent Pool**: Ensure you have an agent pool set up that includes agents capable of running Terraform.

### Steps to Configure Azure DevOps Pipeline

1. **Set Up Azure DevOps Service Connection**:
   - Go to your Azure DevOps project.
   - Navigate to **Project Settings** > **Service connections**.
   - Click on **New service connection** and select **Azure Resource Manager**.
   - Follow the prompts to create a service connection.

2. **Configure Branch Policies**:
   - Go to **Repos** > **Branches**.
   - Click on the ellipsis (â€¦) next to your branch (e.g., `main`) and select **Branch policies**.
   - Enable **Require a minimum number of reviewers** and set the desired number of approvals.

3. **Create the Pipeline YAML**:
   - In your repository, create a file named `azure-pipelines.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
trigger: none  # Disable CI trigger for direct commits

pr:
  branches:
    include:
      - main  # Specify the branch for PR validation

stages:
  - stage: Terraform
    displayName: 'Terraform Plan and Apply'
    jobs:
      - job: TerraformJob
        displayName: 'Run Terraform'
        pool:
          vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
        steps:
          - checkout: self
          
          - task: UseTerraform@0
            inputs:
              command: 'init'
              workingDirectory: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/path/to/terraform/code'
          
          - task: UseTerraform@0
            inputs:
              command: 'plan'
              workingDirectory: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/path/to/terraform/code'
              args: '-out=tfplan'
          
          - task: UseTerraform@0
            inputs:
              command: 'apply'
              workingDirectory: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/path/to/terraform/code'
              args: 'tfplan'
              condition: eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest')
```

### Explanation of the YAML Pipeline

- **Trigger**: Set to `none` to prevent direct commits from triggering the pipeline. The pipeline will only run on PRs.
- **PR Section**: Specifies that the pipeline should run for pull requests to the `main` branch.
- **Stages and Jobs**: Defines a single stage with a job that runs the Terraform commands.
- **UseTerraform Task**: This task is used to run Terraform commands (`init`, `plan`, and `apply`). Make sure you have the Azure DevOps Terraform extension installed.
- **Working Directory**: Adjust the path to your Terraform code as necessary.
- **Condition**: The apply command will only run if the reason for the build is a pull request.

### Additional Security Considerations

- **Secrets Management**: Use Azure Key Vault to manage sensitive data (like secrets, access tokens, etc.) and integrate it with Terraform.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Consider integrating tools like `tfsec` or `Checkov` to scan the Terraform code for security vulnerabilities before applying changes.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Ensure you have logging and monitoring in place to track the execution of your pipeline and any changes made to your infrastructure.

### Final Steps

1. **Commit the YAML File**: Commit the `azure-pipelines.yml` file to your repository.
2. **Create a Pull Request**: Create a PR to the `main` branch. After the required approvals are granted, the pipeline will trigger and execute the Terraform code.
3. **Monitor Pipeline**: Monitor the execution of the pipeline in Azure DevOps and review the output for any errors or warnings.

This setup allows you to manage your infrastructure as code securely while ensuring that changes are reviewed before being applied.
